# nnUNet-Transformer_WBCSegmentation
The objective of this project is to develop two distinct segmentation models for white blood cell (WBC) segmentation. The first model is based on the nnU-Net framework, and the second model incorporates the Vision Transformer (ViT) into the nnU-Net framework. Both models involve preprocessing of data, training with 5 different folds, and evaluating the segmentation results on test cases.
Please make sure the dataset files are structured like the following example picture.
